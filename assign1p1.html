    <h3>Who is him</h3>
    a French blue man.
    <h3>What atrocity has he committed</h3>
    He has been harrassing me constantly on a daily basis, and is unproductive.
    <h3>Why should we ostracize him</h3>
    For the above reasons.
    And take a look at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/join/Distar?">his patreon</a>, he is charging a ridiculously expensive amount.
